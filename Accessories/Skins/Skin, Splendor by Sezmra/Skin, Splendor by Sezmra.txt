Thank you for your interest in my work!

This is a skin resource kit for females, called "Splendor".

**You are free to use these files to create your own skins for your Second Life avatar, no matter what Grid you are using it on.
**You are free to alter these files to create your own skins in order to resell them.
**You are NOT encouraged to redistribute these files, commercially, as is.  Please don't take advantage of others - it may return to haunt you.

Regarding these files:

In each file there are three BASE SKIN LAYERS, each one a different skin tone.  You can use these with different opacity settings to create your own level of skin tone.  For instance, you can make the base layer and the base dark layer visible, and set the base dark layer to 50% opacity to create a skin tone that's in the middle of the two.

Each file's BASE SKIN LAYER group has a layer mask as well - this allows you to create a skin that is partially transparent so that you may alter the hue in Second Life with the skin color sliders.  All you have to do to toggle this mask on and off is SHIFT-LEFT click it.  Now - save the skin file as a .PNG file.

When it comes to the SplendorHead.psd - you must always save the file as a .PNG or .TGA in order for the avatar eyelashes to be visible.  I highly suggest you always save as a .PNG file - because then you do not have to fool with alpha channels and .TGA files.
