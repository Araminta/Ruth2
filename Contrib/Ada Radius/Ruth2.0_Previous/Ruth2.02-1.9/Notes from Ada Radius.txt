Sorry I have been AFK, I caught that ugly flu mutation that's been going around, am just starting to sit up and look around. 

I uploaded the regrettably named OSRuth2.02Ada1.9legacyUVMap1.2.blend, two dae files (flat foot and high foot versions) that go with it and the UV maps. It's still a draft, but it's a better draft. I got most stuff working pretty well with the Robin Wood and CMFF templates and the Eloh skins, but there are a few things that need tweaking, by someone who is better at this than I am. The feet, blech. I have not tested this inworld.

The snapshot shows the system avatar next to Ruth2.0 - matched up as well as I could.  

I see there are some new people in our merry band - is anyone good at this kind of UV mapping? It's a total PITA and feels like a colossol waste of time to map to a bad mesh that's well over ten years old, but every place I take Ruth out to be looked at, the first question is: "Can I use my skin textures?" So we persevere. 

While I was trying to make the exports, one of those Blender data snafus happened, and I had to reload and repack all the textures and reset the armature shape. That's not good, and I might have missed some settings - this version needs a thorough bug check.

I need to take a break for a few weeks, rest and work on some clothing models. YAY +Shin Ingen we have a beauty to design around. There are plans for a fashion show in Kitely in February and if all goes well I'll have a small collection for Fashion Ruthie (slender shape version, I'm working on it) to put on the runway.

I'm looking forward to working on Roth.
