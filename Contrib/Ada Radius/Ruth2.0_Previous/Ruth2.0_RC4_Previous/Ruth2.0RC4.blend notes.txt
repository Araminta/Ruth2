WORK IN THIS FILE:
                    Save Pose library datablocks
                    Delete unneeded Avastar stuff that came in with appended mesh
                    unbind and reskin everything to new armature, keeping weights
                    join upper body, lower body and hands, remove doubles
                    assign materials and make simple node setups
                    rename to Ruth2_RC4_BODY, Ruth2_RC4_FEET_high, Ruth2_RC4_FEET_med, Ruth2_RC4_FEET_flat
                    set AutoSmooth to 90 for all pieces
                    reset data transfer modifier assignmants
                    minor remodel to center loop, snap center loop to x=0, snap the mesh to symmetry
                    minor smoothing to torso and upper-lower body seam
                    
TESTING to mBones:
    Hand weights tested against Sundance's Ruth2_HandPose_Library
    Flat feet tested against against Ada's Foot poses and general animations inworld 
    Overall to Medhue's free pose library sets (commercial and noncommercial use allowed)   
                    
        Neck:
            Added mNeck vertex group and assigned top row loop 100%
            Extend NECK influence down another loop, and blur
            NOTE: the neck seam is still unsnapping in extreme mNeck positions, but it's better. 
                    
        Arms:  
            Redo CLAVICLE weights  - better shoulder, chest, back and underarm deformation with mCollar bone moves
            Redo UPPER_ARM weights - better shoulder and elbow deformation with mShoulder bone moves
            Adjust LOWER_ARM weights - better elbow, wrist to hand deformation with mElbow bone moves
                    
        Hands:  
            Adj weights near or in palm - weight limit per vert, deformation
            Clean up hand weights (fix stray verts, ranges not following loops, weight limit per vert) 
    
        Chest
           Reweighted CHEST, PECS and UPPER BACK to improve definition of rib cage when mChest bone moves. 
            
        Torso
           Reweighted BELLY, HANDLEs, LOWER_BACK - improve definition of belly to rib cage when mTorso moves. 
                                     
        Pelvis
            Reweighted PELVIS, BUTT for better sit and ground sit while moving mPelvis bone.
                        
        Legs
            Better blending with PELVIS and BUTT. Added edge loops at the upper thigh to help with sits.          
                                               
        Feet_high:         
            tweak UV map - uncross edges, adjust verts at the toes
            assign a material to the nail faces so the map can be used with other skins more easily
            minor fixes to weights (ranges not following loops)
            fix symmetry, snap to lower leg       
                                            
        Feet_medium
            remove nail faces
            assign a material to the nail faces so the map can be used with other skins more easily
            copy UV maps from high foot
            adjust toenail verts similar to high foot
            Adjust weights similar to high foot (not exact match as verts are different distances from bones)
            Clean up ranges not following loops
            fix symmetry, snap to lower leg 
                    
        Feet_flat                 
            assign materials 
            tweak UV and model - toenails
            minor fixes to weights - ranges not following loops
            fix symmetry, snap to lower leg  
            NOTE: these weights are different than for high and medium foot, so that the flat feet can be posed to any heel height plus a few dance positions. 
                    
                    
                      
TESTING AGAINST THE APPEARANCE SLIDERS: see http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Avatar_sliders
    
    Body fat:
         affected by weights in BELLY, CHEST, HEAD, LEFT_HANDLE, LEFT_PEC, LOWER_BACK, L_CLAVICLE, L_LOWER_ARM, L_LOWER_LEG, L_UPPER_ARM, L_UPPER_LEG, NECK, PELVIS, RIGHT_HANDLE, RIGHT_PEC, R_CLAVICLE, R_LOWER_ARM, R_LOWER_LEG, R_UPPER_ARM, R_UPPER_LEG, UPPER_BACK.
        I got it to smooth out by smoothing Shin's topography at the top of the belly. We lost some rib cage definition :( 
    
    Torso Muscles:
        according to SLWiki, affected by BELLY, CHEST, L_CLAVICLE, L_LOWER_ARM, _UPPER_ARM, R_CLAVICLE, R_LOWER_ARM, R_UPPER_ARM, UPPER_BACK, but it looks as though BELLY and CHEST are not influencing much. 
    
    Neck Thickness
        Affected by mNeck according to the SL Wiki, but it's clearly affected more by NECK. Working OK. 

    Breast Size, gravity, female cleavage
        affected by LEFT_PEC, RIGHT_PEC.
        Breast volume weights are OK for big breasts, ugly for small breasts. I've tried a combination of changing weights and a little resculpting, but I think it would need a redesign of the topology to fix it, and that would ruin Shin's shaping. (a less natural grapefruit shape rather than banana, with even concentric circles and no center grid. I think.) 

    Love Handles
        affected by BELLY, LEFT_HANDLE, LOWER_BACK, RIGHT_HANDLE.
        Minor fixes. These look good to me - I wanted corset shapes for historical costumes, and we have that now. 

    Belly Size
        according to SL WIki, affected by BELLY, PELVIS, but it's obvious that anything clamped to mTorso and mPelvis is affecting the slider to include BUTT, LEFT_HANDLE, RIGHT_HANDLE, LOWER_BACK. 
        Fixing this ruins the weighting needed to make good sits - it would be better to make a preggers av, if that's wanted.  
        
    Saddlebags
     	affected by PELVIS.
        working OK     
    
    Butt Size
        affected by BUTT, PELVIS
        fixed the sideways pancake issue with 0%
        working OK
     
    Leg Muscles: L_LOWER_LEG, L_UPPER_LEG, R_LOWER_LEG, _UPPER_LEG. Looks OK to me. 

    Bowed Legs: L_LOWER_LEG, L_UPPER_LEG, R_LOWER_LEG, _UPPER_LEG. Fixed leg vert issue that hadn't shown up in other tests. 

    Foot Size: L_FOOT, R_FOOT. Working well for FEET_High and FEET_medium, and OK for FEET_Flat 
    
       
    TO DO Append Sundance's fingernails and toenails in another file
    TO DO design alpha cuts in another file
    TO DO a G-rated version of this file
                    
VERTEX COUNTS:
    Body: 8768
    Feet_flat: 2516
    Feet_high: 2484
    Feet_med: 2484
    
    Total vertex counts will increase quite a bit after the alpha cuts.
