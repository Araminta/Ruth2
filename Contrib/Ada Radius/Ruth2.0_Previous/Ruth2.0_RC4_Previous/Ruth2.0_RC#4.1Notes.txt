WORK IN THIS FILE:
The problem: UV maps on lower body in RC#4DRAFT mismatched at the back upper leg, and I had altered the mesh enough that transferring the UV map from RC#3 was no longer possible.

I copied weights from RC#4DRAFT body to ru2BODY_lower_RC#3, deleted the lower half of RC#4DRAFT and swapped in RC#3. Rejoined, matched waist seam. Then did a redo on the modeling changes (extra loop at upper thigh, smoothing belly) that I had done on RC#4DRAFT. Retested against the poses. Fixed a few things on weights I had missed - CLAVICLEs on arm stretched back.

Snapped symmetry, fixed Data Transfer assignments, etc. 

There were errors on the UV map from RC#3 as well, some of them mine; that's why we have different versions since RC#3. For this round I used the CMFF and the Robin Wood templates and worked on the lower body UV and some minor tweaks at the waistline seam on the upper body. Matching front to back and left to right, checking against a Starlight skin. 

Adapting a lovely 2018 mesh to a 2005 mesh's UV that wasn't good even then, will always have issues. Every improvement over the last four RC's has introduced new errors, which I may well have done here as well.
