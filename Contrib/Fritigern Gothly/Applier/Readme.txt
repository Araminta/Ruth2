The following usage instructions are deliberately written in a way that also less experienced users should be able to follow them.

INSTALLING THE APPLIERS:

Installing the Core (this assumes that the links of the body have been renamed to match the names in the script)
-----------------
1- Edit the Ruth 2.0 body and create a new script inside it. 
2- Open the new script and replace all the text with the text from the applier core (https://pastebin.com/4dbuzz0k).
3- Press the "save" button and the installation should be complete.

Creating a skin applier
---------------------
1- Create a box on the ground
2- Create a script inside the box.
3- Open the new script and replace all the text with the text from the skin applier (https://pastebin.com/5wpjftUg).
4- Collect the UUIDs of the 3 skin textures (head or face, upper and lower) and replace the existing UUIDs with the new ones.
5- Press the "save" button and the skin applier should now be working.
6- Resize the box to something much smaller and take it into your inventory, then wear it by right-clicking it, choose "wear" => "HUD" and pick a free spot (this needs to be done only once!)

Creating a nails applier
---------------------
1- Create a box on the ground
2- Create a script inside the box.
3- Open the new script and replace all the text with the text from the nails applier (https://pastebin.com/0bFL4Dtx).
4- Collect the UUIDs of the nails textures (toes and fingers) and replace the existing UUIDs with the new ones.
5- Press the "save" button and the skin applier should now be working.
6- Resize the box to something much smaller and take it into your inventory, then wear it by right-clicking it, choose "wear" => "HUD" and pick a free spot (this needs to be done only once!)
