The scripts in the ***Appliers*** folder are deprecated. Yet, feel free to use them in case they are useful to you, or use parts of it, I don't care.

My shapes are placed in the ***Shapes*** folder. Import them into the viewer by creating a new shape, edit the shape and hit the "Import" button at the bottom of the floater (the "edit appearance" screen).
