The same script can go in all body parts (head, body, feet, hands and eyes)

This script is backwardsly compatible, so if the new hud is used on an older body it will work just without the extra BOM or materials details.

In the same way if a hud made for an older version of Ruth is used on a body with this script, that will be detected and applied like the old reciver script did.
