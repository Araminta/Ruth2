If you look at the snapshot it will give a clear idea how the hud is supposed to look.

The principle for how the hud works is exactly the same as the last hud, the difference is in the addition of BOM, apply all and material information. 

Each collum and row has different naming protols.

All the top row buttons are called "BtnApplyAll" + a number relating the collum number. 
All the 2nd row buttons are called "BtnEyes" + a number reflecting the collum number.
All the 3rd row buttons are called "BtnHead" + a number reflecting the collum number.
All the 4th row buttons are called "BtnUpper" + a number reflecting the collum number.
All the 5th row buttons are called "BtnLower" + a number reflecting the collum number.

The collum number for all the Bakes on mesh buttons is "0". So the use Bakes on Mesh button for all items is called "BtnApplyAll0".
