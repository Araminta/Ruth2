Ruth2 is a low-poly mesh body specifically designed for OpenSimulator.
It is built to use standard Second Life(TM) UV maps using scratch-built open
source mesh bodies by Shin Ingen with other open source contributions from the
OpenSimulator Community.

This is a further development of Duck Girl's RuthRC3_BakesOnMesh_Slim 2.dae. To better fit clothing made for Maitreya the shoulders are lifted a bit. The groin is changed and the UV map is fixed at the groin to prevent to much stretching of the texture there.
