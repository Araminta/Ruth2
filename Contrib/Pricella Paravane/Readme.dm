I heard of problems uploading some of the body parts. Sometimes it will give an other error. To solve this:

Go to top menu "Advanced" and "Show Debug Settings" (or use Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S)
Look in the list for 'ImporterLegacyMatching' and set the value to TRUE.

That solved the problem for me. Myra Foil.
