I heard of problems uploading some of the body parts. Sometimes it will give an other error. To solve this:

Go to top menu "Advanced" and "Show Debug Settings" (or use Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S)
Look in the list for 'ImporterLegacyMatching' and set the value to TRUE.

That solved the problem for me. Myra Foil.

The DAE only has the lower and the upper body and the hands and fingernails. Use any head on it and for the feet use Duck Girl's feet.
