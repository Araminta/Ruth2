This is a further development by Pricella Paravane of Duck Girl's RuthRC3_BakesOnMesh_Slim 2.dae. To better fit clothing made for Maitreya the shoulders are lifted a bit. The groin is changed and the UV map is fixed at the groin to prevent too much stretching of the texture there.

Lower body and upper body with hands and finger nails as Collada (.dae).

This can be used with the previous Duck Girl "Slim" version of the head, and three heights of feet plus toenails.

There may be problems uploading the .dae file. Sometimes it will give an other error. To solve this Myra Foil suggests:

Go to top menu "Advanced" and "Show Debug Settings" (or use Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S).
Look in the list for 'ImporterLegacyMatching' and set the value to TRUE.
