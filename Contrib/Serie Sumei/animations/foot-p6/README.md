# Foot Animations

Most of these foot animations come from Sundance's High_Heel_Animations
directory but have been modified to import at Priority 6 so they
do not get overridden by incidental animations.

The secondlife_anklelock.anim file is converted from Wizardry and Steamworks at
http://grimore.org/_media/secondlife/avatar_animation_locks/secondlife_anklelock.bvh
to .anim format at priority 6.
