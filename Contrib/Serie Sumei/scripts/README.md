# Contrib/Serie Sumei/scripts

These scripts are experimental/development versions of the scripts
in the main Scripts directory.

## Versioning

These scripts will carry a version similar to 'ss-X' where X is
usually a letter.  The scripts in the Scripts directory will have
a version similar to 'v3.N' where N is a number.  This hopefully
makes it easier to distinguish between the two, as they may reference
each other.

For example, ru2_hud_control.lsl ss-r was copied to
Scripts/ru2_hud_control.lsl v3.0 for the initial version for Ruth2 v3.
