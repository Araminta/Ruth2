# HUD textures

This directory contains both the original GIMP source files and exported
PNG files for Ruth2 and Roth2 HUDs.  Some of these are shared between
the two with no changes, some of them keep both versions in the same GIMP
file (such as the header image).

Note: All exported images are resized to 512x512 if they are larger than
that.  GIMP seems to do a cleaner job of resizing them than letting the viewer
do it in-world.
