Using Ada's Version 1.9 of Ruth (OSRuth2_02Ada1.9legacyUVMap1.2AlphaCut.blend), I made an additional set of UV maps of the feet.  The new UV maps are compatible with Avastar's new mesh body called Avamesh. (Like Ruth, the rest of the Avamesh character uses standard SL UV maps.)  The maps make it far easier to prepare textures for feet attachments.  Since Avastar has become the tool of choice for those working with mesh in OpenSim and SL, this adds an additional layer of compatibility for Ruth 2.  Other than the new UV maps and one short seam on the inside of each foot, no other alterations have been made to the blend file.  The topology, weighting, SL UV maps, etc. remains unchanged.
