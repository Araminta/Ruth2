The blend file OSRuth2_CurrentRelease_DEVKIT_CURIOUS_TAARNA_r2FEET_RC#3 is a mix between:

OSRuth2_CurrentRelease_DEVKIT for clothing and weighting.blend
OSRuth2_CurrentRelease_AdaEdit_RC3TWEAKEDFEETUVCURIOUS

I reused the nails made by Sundance Haiku.
I made a minor change on the flat and high feet toes.
With the UV mapping from Curious Creator you are able to use old skins in Blender or inworld.

What is new:
The medium feet.
All feet do have a very basic weighting for shoes.
The vertices from the end of all left feet are aligned with the left leg.

Have fun :)
