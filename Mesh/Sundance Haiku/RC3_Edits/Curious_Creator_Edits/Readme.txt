I have added Curious Creator's Blender File so it is a bit easier to access.  Originally, I thought Curious had edits on my Release3_AdaEdit_SundanceEdit_09.blend file.  But now after looking over the file, I can see that my edits of the UV's on the lower legs are not present. The file that she used was OSRuth2_CurrentRelease_AdaEdit_RC3.blend.  That was later confirmed on a Google + posting.

Here are Curious' notes on changes she made to OSRuth2_CurrentRelease_AdaEdit_RC3.blend . . .
