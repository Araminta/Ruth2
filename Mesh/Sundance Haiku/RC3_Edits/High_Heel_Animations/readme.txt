For convenience, I created animation files of each of Ada's high heel poses.  I want to see what they looked like in-world - and they look quite nice!  Good work Ada!  

This will give people a chance to give them a try and see how they will work with various heel heights.

I also include a rest pose (flat feet - default) animation to bring the heel height back to it's default position.
