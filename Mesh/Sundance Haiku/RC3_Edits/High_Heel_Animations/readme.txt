As you may know Shin and Ada are looking into the possibility of using static poses to place the flat feet in various positions for high heels.  Ada – who has contributed so much to this project - has already weighted the flat feet for that purpose.  In my work with the flat feet, I only made UV changes.  I did not make any changes in Ada’s weighting.

Ada has created five poses for the flat feet to be used with heels.  She has created poses for 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 inch (US) or 25, 50, 75, 100 & 125 mm (Metric).  (She also has a Pointe pose for any ballerinas out there.) 

Using Ada’s poses (found in the Pose Library in Blender), I exported each to ANIM files.  I created one additional pose (the default flat foot position) and exported that as well.  

I want to see what they looked like in-world - and they look quite nice!  Good work Ada!  

Members of the Ruth 2 community might want to have a look and see how the poses appear when used in-world.  You can find the animation files in following GitHub directory:  Ruth/Mesh/Avatar Ruth/Sundance Haiku/RC3_Edits/High_Heel_Animations.  

To use the animations on the Ruth character in-world, you’ll also need to upload the DAE files of the various body parts found in the following directory:  Ruth/Mesh/Avatar Ruth/Sundance Haiku/RC3_Edits/RC3_Final/. 

The poses were all exported using a Level 4 priority, and that, of course, may change depending how poses work when combined with dance animations, etc.  Members of the Ruth community with expertise in the animation area may be able to help in that regard. 

Ada has given us a great start.  There is still some work that needs to be done so that flat feet respond better when an avatar’s sliders are used to change the size of the foot.  Taarna Welles has kindly volunteered to do work in that area.  

Just a reminder:  anyone should feel free to dig in and help if they see aspects of the project in which they can provide assistance.

My job moves me to the field for the summer, and the only time I have Internet access is when I’m able to get back into town.  So, I wanted to get as much detailed information posted on GitHub before I leave at the end of the week.
