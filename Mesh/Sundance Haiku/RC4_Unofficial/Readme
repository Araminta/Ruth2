To make files a bit easier to find, I've added a "RC4_Unofficial" directory.  This is work that I've done after the RC3 release that might have some possibilities for the next Ruth release.

Ada Radius had posted a note on the Ruth MeWe community site and asked about RC3 work on the feet.  I had done extensive work on the UV's of both the flat and high feet, as well as some work on lower part of the body.  I hadn't quite finished when Shin was ready to release RC3.  For the RC3 release, Shin used my Version 15 file.   I finished up my changes to the UV's in a Version 16.  These weren't included in the RC3 release, but I wanted to make them available if it would be helpful at some future time.  The full name of the Version 16 file is: Release3_AdaShinEdit_SundanceEdit_16.blend and is found in the following GitHub directory: RuthAndRoth\Mesh\Avatar Ruth\Sundance Haiku\RC4_Unofficial.

Some time after the RC3 release, I had done some work on the alphas.  At least one creator had explained that it would be helpful to be able to select alphas either on the right or left in the pelvic area.   RC3 and previous releases did not have that flexibility because the alphas on the right and left sides were linked together.  I re-worked the alphas in this area to provide that flexibility.  I also added a bit more flexibility in the breast area.  The overall alpha arrangement stays pretty much the same so that most clothing created in past versions would compatible with the newer alpha arrangement.  The name of this file in which I did the new alpha arrangement is: ShinRC3_SundanceNewAlphas.blend and is found in the following GitHub directory: RuthAndRoth\Mesh\Avatar Ruth\Sundance Haiku\RC4_Unofficial

Since at the time I did this work, RC3 was the official release, I made the changes to the RC3 source file.  I did, however, include the changes I made in version 16.  Shin's RC3 source file is found in the previous Ruth GitHub site under the the following directory:  Ruth\Mesh\Avatar Ruth\Current Release, and is named OSRuth2_CurrentRelease_Source_RC3.blend.  

I've also re-worked the Alpha HUD so that it works with the new alpha arrangement described above and will post it when I'm able to free up some time.

All Good Things,

Sundance
