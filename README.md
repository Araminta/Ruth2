# Ruth2 Mesh Avatar Project

Ruth2 is a low-poly mesh body specifically designed for OpenSimulator.
It is built to use standard Second Life(TM) UV maps using scratch-built open
source mesh bodies by Shin Ingen with other open source contributions from the
OpenSimulator Community.

## Personal Directories

We have moved all personal directories under the new top-level directory
'Contrib'.  These continue to be used as they always have, as a place for
team members to put things that are still under development before (or until)
they are merged into the master release directories.

Directories for contributors that have fallen inactive will be periodically removed
from the current master (usually around release time) but will always be available
in the archive release branches.

## Upload Meshes and Artifacts

Since not everyone is set up to perform Blender exports to get the Collada files
for uploading we maintain recent exported .dae files.  These correspond to the
.blend files in the Mesh directory.

There is also an IAR file that can be uset to pre-load OpenSim grids.  These are
usually updated at releases.  They will maintain consistent UUIDs for the
assets to minimize duplication when uploading multiple releases for unchanged
files.

## Licenses

Ruth2 is AGPL licensed, other contents of this repository are also
AGPL licensed unless otherwise indicated.  See LICENSE.md for specific details.

## Reference Files

The original Ruth repo contained a number of reference files archived from
various places around the Internet.  Some of those have become hard to find
due to link rot and sites vanishing.

Those archived files are now in their own repo https://github.com/RuthAndRoth/Reference.
